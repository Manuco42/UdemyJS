// CHAT GPT EXCERCISES REST AND SPREAD OPERATOR

// Spread Operator Exercises:

// Create an object that contains some properties and values. Use the spread operator to create a new object with the same properties and values, but with an additional property.

const obj1 = { fName: 'manu', lName: 'gimenez' };
const obj2 = { ...obj1, property };
console.log(arr2);

// Create a function that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns the largest number using the Math.max method and the spread operator.

// Create a function that takes an object as an argument and returns a new object with all the same properties and values, except for one property that is changed using the spread operator.

// Create an array of strings. Use the spread operator to create a new array with the same strings, but with one string added to the end.

// const arr1 = ['manu', 'joaq', 'gimenez'];
// const arr2 = [...arr1, 'what'];
// console.log(arr2);

// Create a function that takes two arrays as arguments and returns a new array that combines the elements of both arrays using the spread operator.

// let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
// let arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
// const arrayComb = function (array1, array2) {
//   let newArray = [...array1, ...array2];
//   return newArray;
// };

// console.log(arrayComb(arr1, arr2));

// Rest Operator Exercises:

// Create a function that takes any number of arguments and returns their sum using the rest operator.

// Create an array of numbers. Use the rest operator to pass the array elements as arguments to a function that returns their sum.

// Create a function that takes an array of strings and returns a new array with only the strings that have a length greater than a certain value. Use the rest operator to pass the strings as arguments to the function.

// Create a function that takes a string and a number as arguments. The string should be repeated the number of times specified by the number argument using the repeat method and the rest operator.

// Create an object with some properties and values. Use the rest operator to create a new object with all the same properties and values, except for one property that is changed based on a new value passed as an argument.
